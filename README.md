# learn_react
This is Marty's repository for setting up a react webapp that has a python backend served via a Flask app.

Before starting you will need the following:

* Python 3
* Flask
* Node.js
* npm (should come with Node.js)

To start, clone the repository, then in the js folder, run the following to fetch the required Javascript modules.

```bash
$ npm install
```

To develop, run the following to allow live updating of the react compiled Javascript file.

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

To see changes, either run html with a live server (e.g. in Visual Studio Code) or with Flask in python.
